# datapunt-api tooling

Most of out api's are build using djang-rest-framework.
The browsable API and fast prototyping and very mature
and complete evironment make this the go-to tool to
make data publicly available.

To improve the consitency between API's it is nice
if they work and look and feel the same way.

after installing  pip install drf-amsterdam
the module:

import datapunt\_api is available.
And help to quickly create a data.amsterdam.nl like
API.
