# Contributing

We – the maintainers of this project and the City of Amsterdam – value your input, enjoy feedback and welcome improvements to our Open Source projects.

We love issues and pull requests from everyone.

## Problems, suggestions and questions

You don't need to change any of our code or documentation to be a contributor. Many contributors add to our software by reporting problems, suggesting changes and asking simple and difficult questions. To do this, you can create a [GitHub Issues](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).

We typically respond to new issues within a few business days.

## Documentation and code

If you want to add to the documentation or code of one of our projects you should make a Pull Request. If you never used GitHub, get up to speed with [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

### 1. Fork

Fork the repository and make a new branch from the default branch.

### 2. Commit

Add your changes in commits with a message that explains your process.

If you make choices or decisions in your commits, please use the commit comment to elaborate, this will enable everyone to be informed of your choices in the future by using the poorly named `git blame` (which should be called `git credit`).

If you are adding code, make sure it is adequately documented and adheres to the project's code style guide before you submit your pull request. You can read more about how to document and style your code in the project's [README](README.md).

### 3. Pull Request

When submitting the pull request, please accompany it with a description of the problem you are trying to address and the issue numbers that this Pull Request fixes/addresses. This makes it easier for the maintainers to review and merge your code.

### 4. Improve

It could be that your contribution can be merged immediately by a maintainer. However, usually, a new Pull Request needs some improvements before it can be merged. Both another contributor or a robot in our continuous integration workflow might have feedback. If this is the case the reviewing maintainer will help you improve your documentation and code.

If your documentation and code have passed review and are accepted by our continuous integration tools, it is merged.

### 5. Celebrate

Your ideas, documentation and code have become an integral part of this project. You are the Open Source hero we need.

We typically respond to new pull requests within a few business days.
