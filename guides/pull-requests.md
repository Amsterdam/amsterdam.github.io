# Pull requests

Pull requests (as they are named on GitHub) or Merge requests (as they are named on GitLab) are proposed changes to a codebase. They are submitted by a contributor to a project and accepted or rejected by a repository's maintainers. Pull requests each have their own discussion forum enabling a collaborative review of the committed code. 

For a basic guide on how PRs work read GitHub's excelent guide [Using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/.)
