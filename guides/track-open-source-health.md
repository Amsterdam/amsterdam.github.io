# How we track Open Source health

## Reusability

We strive to make our code generally reusable for everyone who would like to solve the same problems as we do, our projects are not all at that level yet. We grade our project on the following scale:

1. **Custom, opaque**: Very specific and not easy to learn from. Might lack documentation or might have non-English code and documentation. Might contain copyrighted content or lack an [Open Source licence](https://opensource.org/licenses).
2. **Custom, reference**: Specific to our case and documented, can be used to learn from.
3. **Adaptable**. Documented and possible to adapt.
4. **Reusable, specifically configured**. Configured specifically for our use, easily reconfigurable. 
5. **Reusable**. Fully (externally) configurable and useful for anyone.
