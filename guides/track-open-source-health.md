# How we track Open Source health

## Reusability

We strive to make our code generally reusable for everyone who would like to solve the same problems as we do, our projects are not all at that level yet. We grade our project on the following scale:

1. **Custom, opaque**: Very specific and not easy to learn from. Might lack documentation, have non-English code and documentation, contain copyrighted content or lack an [Open Source licence](https://opensource.org/licenses).
2. **Custom, reference**: Specific to our case and documented, can be used to learn from.
3. **Adaptable**. Documented and possible to adapt.
4. **Reusable, configured**. Configured specifically for our use, easily reconfigurable. 
5. **Reusable**. Fully (externally) configurable and useful for anyone.

As our goal is to make as much of the code we develop as reusable as possible. We would love to collaborate with you on implementing it in your situation, improving the reusability in the process. File an issue in the GitHub repository belonging to the project or send us an email and we'll try to help you as soon as possible.
